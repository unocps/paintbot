\begin{abstract}
The construction industry faces challenges of worker safety, stagnant productivity due to an aging workforce and shortage of skilled labor, and inconsistent quality. Contrary to other industries facing similar issues, autonomous robotics has seen limited adoption by the construction industry as a solution to these challenges. This project provides an implementation of a small, mobile, autonomous robotics platform capable of performing fine-grained construction tasks in dynamic environments. Such tasks include painting, drilling screws, and transporting material and equipment. This project is intended to be a proof of concept and starting point for further development. The platform is tested with a simulated robot based on the KUKA youBot tasked with painting walls in a room containing obstacles. The simulations show that the proposed platform is promising but that the algorithms used for localization, navigation planning, and task planning must be improved or replaced with solutions better tailored to the situations and hardware.
